1. Introduction:
This project aims to develop a user-friendly website, "StudyPlan" that enables students to create personalized timetables made in accordance with their academic schedules and free time preferences. Effective time management is crucial for academic success, and this website will provide a simple yet powerful tool to help students organize their courses, study time, and personal commitments.
2. Project Goals:
•	Develop a web-based application that allows students to input their course details (name, days, times, location, instructor - optional).
•	Enable students to specify their free time availability on a weekly basis.
•	Generate a visual timetable that integrates course schedules with free time.
•	Save and load personalized timetables.
3. Target Audience:
The primary target audience for this project is students at all levels, including high school, college, and university students. The website will be designed to be accessible for users with varying levels of technical proficiency.
4. Project Features:
•	Course Input: A form for entering course details, including: 
o	Course/Subject Name (required)
o	Days of the Week (checkboxes or multi-select)
o	Start and End Times (required, using time pickers if possible)
•	Suitable Time Input: A mechanism for students to specify their available free time, ideally using checkboxes for days and time ranges, or more advanced time range selectors.
•	Timetable Display: A clear and visually appealing weekly timetable grid: 
o	Days of the week as columns.
o	Time slots as rows.
o	Course names displayed in the appropriate cells.
o	Visual cues (e.g., colour coding) to distinguish between course time and free time.
o	Highlighting of any scheduling conflicts (courses overlapping with free time).
•	User-Friendly Interface: A clean, and responsive design that is accessible on different devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
9. Conclusion:
•	The "StudyPlan" website will provide a valuable tool for students to manage their time effectively and achieve their academic goals. By combining a user-friendly interface with essential scheduling features, this project will contribute to improved student organization and productivity.
